                        True Friends<br /><br />Once upon a time, there were two close friends who were walking through the forest together. They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.<br /><br />Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not know how to climb up the tree. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.<br /><br />The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place because the bears do not want to touch the dead creatures. After that, the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend that was on the ground, "Friend, what did the bear whisper into your ears?" The other friend replied, "Just now the bear advised me not to believe a false friend."<br />

                        The Fish and the Salamander At the beginning of time, Fish and Salamander looked very much alike. They were discussing how they planned to evolve. "I wish to grow thinner, with a broad tail," said Fish. "Then, I will swim like lightning and outrace any pond creature. How about you?" Salamander considered, "Well, it would certainly be nice to be the fastest creature in the pond. However, I think will keep my awkward tail, which allows me to swim well enough. What I wish to change instead is to grow modest legs" Fish laughed. "Legs? In a pond? What a waste!" Soon, though, came a drought and the pond began to dry up. Fish was trapped, but Salamander was able to crawl out, to find another pond. "How did you know that legs would come in so handy?" cried Fish to its departing friend. "I didn't," said Salamander, "But I wasn't so naive as to assume that circumstances today would be the same as that of tomorrow." The story tells us that versatility is a lead to Success.<br />

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Title: The Enchanted Quill: A Tale of Endless Imagination</p><p></p><p>Once in a quaint village, there lived a young girl named Amara. Amara had always possessed a vivid imagination that set her apart from her peers. She loved to spend her days exploring the lush meadows and ancient forests that surrounded her village, allowing her imagination to run wild.</p><p></p><p>One fateful day, while wandering deep into the heart of the forest, Amara stumbled upon a hidden glade. In the center of the glade, she discovered a shimmering quill resting atop a moss-covered stone. It was unlike any quill she had ever seen before, with intricate carvings and a brilliant golden hue. Curiosity overwhelmed her, and she couldn't resist picking it up.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Amara touched the quill, a surge of magical energy coursed through her body. Suddenly, the quill came to life, glowing brightly and emitting a soft hum. Amara's eyes widened with wonder as she realized that this was no ordinary quill—it possessed the power to bring her imagination to life.</p><p></p><p>With the enchanted quill in her hand, Amara's creative ideas took on a life of their own. She began to draw magnificent creatures and fantastical landscapes, and to her amazement, they materialized before her eyes. Majestic dragons soared through the sky, mythical creatures roamed the forests, and castles appeared in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Amara's village soon became a place of enchantment and wonder, as word of her extraordinary gift spread. People from far and wide flocked to witness her creations, eager to experience the magic that her drawings brought to life. Amara shared her gift with others, encouraging them to embrace their own imagination and unlock the endless possibilities within.</p><p></p><p>However, as Amara continued to explore her newfound powers, she realized that the quill was beginning to lose its brilliance. The drawings she brought to life became fainter and less vibrant with each passing day. Worried that she would lose the quill's magic entirely, Amara embarked on a quest to discover the secret behind its fading power.</p><p></p><p>Through her journey, Amara encountered wise sages, mythical beings, and faced various challenges that tested her determination. Finally, after much perseverance, she reached the fabled Fountain of Imagination. Legend had it that drinking from this magical fountain would restore the quill's power.</p><p></p><p>With hope in her heart, Amara took a sip from the fountain, feeling a surge of renewed energy flow through her. She returned to her village, the quill now shining brighter than ever. Amara continued to use her gift, filling her village and the world with awe-inspiring wonders and spreading the joy of imagination.</p><p></p><p>From that day forward, the village became known as "Imaginaria," a place where dreams and imagination knew no bounds. Amara's enchanted quill became a symbol of the limitless power of creativity and the importance of nurturing one's imagination.</p><p></p><p>And so, the tale of "The Enchanted Quill" reminds us that within our minds lies the power to create extraordinary worlds and bring our wildest dreams to life. Embrace your imagination, for it is a gift that holds the key to endless possibilities.</p><p></p><br />

                        CINDERELLA<br /><br /><p>One day, there was a beautiful girl named Cinderella. She lived with a
 wicked stepmother and her two stepsisters. They treated Cinderella very
 bad and did not appreciate her. Near from her home, there was a king’s 
palace which was so beautiful and there would be held a big party. Her 
stepmother and her sisters were invited to attend the party. However, 
they did not allow her to go to the party. She was ordered to sew the 
party dresses that would be worn by her mother and sisters. While, she 
did not have time to sew her dress. Her mother and her sisters went to a
 party and left Cinderella alone at home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She felt very sad and cried. Between her tears, suddenly a fairy 
godmother appeared and said “do not cry, I can send you to the ball 
now!”, But she kept crying and looked so sad. She said, “I do not have a
 dress to wear in the ball”. The fairy godmother of course would not be 
worry and waved the wand to transform the Cinderella’s old clothes into 
the new dress which was very beautiful. Furthermore, that fairy 
godmother touched Cinderella’s foot with the ​​wand and suddenly 
Cinderella had beautiful glass slippers. Cinderella was shocked and 
said, “wow, thank you, but how I could go to the ball?”. Fairy godmother
 then went into the kitchen and saw four rats. She turned it into golden
 four horses and into a beautiful buggy. Before leaving home, the Fairy 
Godmother said “Cinderella, you have to go home at middle of the night, 
because this magic will works only until midnight!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When Cinderella entered the palace, everyone was stunned by her 
beautiful face. In fact, no one recognized her because she was so 
different. Cinderella was so pretty with the dress and the glass 
slippers. A handsome prince also saw Cinderella and he fell in love. He 
met Cinderella and asked, “Do you want to dance?” And she said, “yes, I 
want to dance with you”. Prince and Cinderella danced during the night 
and she was so happy at that night. She forgot the fairy godmother 
warning that she should go home in the middle of the night. At the last 
moment, Cinderella remembered her promise to the fairy godmother and 
went home. “I must go!”, said her. She ran quickly and one of her glass 
slippers left but she did not come back to pick it up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cinderella arrived home a few minutes later. When she arrived, the 
clock struck in twelve. The horses and the buggy back into the previous 
shape and she did not wear the glass slippers and the beautiful dress 
anymore. After that, her stepmother and sisters came home and talked 
about the beautiful women who danced with the prince. They were very 
curious about the identity of the woman who suddenly appeared.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the palace, Prince kept thinking about Cinderella and he fell in 
love. Prince wanted to find out the identity of the girl, but he even 
did not know her name. Prince has only found the glass slipper, and he 
said, “I will find her, and I will marry the woman whose foot fits into 
this glass slipper!”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the next day, the prince and his bodyguards went to all the 
existing home. They wanted to find a woman whose foot matched with the 
size of the shoe. Cinderella stepsisters also tried the glass slipper 
but their feet do not match. When Cinderella wanted to try, her 
stepmother prevented and forbidden her. However, the prince said, “let 
her trying!”. When Cinderella wore a glass slipper, she had a perfect 
leg for the shoe. The prince then recognized her and he was convinced 
that she was a woman who danced with him at the dance. He married 
Cinderella and they lived happily.</p><br /><br /><br />

Despite a Dog, Tumang actually an incarnation of the god and the father of Sangkuriang.<br /><br />One day, he got mad at Tumang for not pursuing the animals. Because of so angry, he then expelled Tumang so the dog went into the woods.<br /><br />He then returned to the palace and told the incident to her mother. Dayang Sumbi was so angry and hit his head. Sangkuriang then disappointed and he decided to wander.<br /><br />After hitting Sangkuriang, Dayang Sumbi felt so sorry and she always prayed and meditated to get forgiveness from God. One day, God gave a gift because she was so diligent in praying. The prize is a timeless beauty that would make Sumbi Dayang becoming young forever.<br /><br />After wandering for a dozen years, Sangkuriang returned home. When he reached the kingdom, all had changed. He did not know what was happening. One day, he met a girl who was so beautiful. The girl was actually a Sumbi Dayang, his own mother.<br /><br />Sangkurian fell in love with the girl and then proposed her. Because of the handsomeness that was owned by Sangkuriang, then Dayang Sumbi also fell in love. One day, Sangkuriang want to hunt and he asked Dayang Sumbi to fix the headband. However, Dayang Sumbi surprised that her future husband had a head injury. Dayang Sumbi then realized that was the same injury as her son who wandered away. She then noticed Sangkuriang face, and she was more surprised to realize that her husband was Sangkuriang, her own son.<br /><br />After those happenings, she immediately looked for ways to thwart the plan of making a proposal. She then proposed two requirements to Sangkuriang. First, Sangkuriang should stem the Citarum River. Secondly, she asked Sangkuriang to make a big canoe to cross the river. Both of those conditions should be finished before sunrise.<br /><br />At night, Sangkuriang asked for help to spirit creatures to complete all the work. Dayang Sumbi secretly peeked at the job. Once the work was almost complete, Dayang Sumbi ordered his forces to hold a very long red carpet to the east of the city.<br /><br />The carpet made ​​the light became red and Sangkuriang thought that the sun had risen. He stopped his work and was very upset because all could not meet the requirements posed by Dayang Sumbi. Using his strength, Sangkuriang broke the dam and the city became flooding.

                            40. cerita narrative sangkuriang dalam bahasa inggris</h2><br />
                        Long time ago in West Java, lived a beautiful girl named Dayang Sumbi. She was also smart and clever. Her beauty and intelligence made a prince from the heavenly kingdom of Kahyangan desire her as his wife. The prince asked permission from his father to marry Dayang Sumbi. People from Kahyangan could never live side by side with humans, but his father approved on one condition, when they had a child, the prince would transform into a dog. The prince accepted the condition.<br /><br />They get married and lived happily in the woods until Dayang Sumbi gave birth to a baby boy. The prince then changed into a dog named Tumang. Their son is named Sangkuriang. He was very smart and handsome like his father. Everyday, he hunted animals and looked for fruits to eat. One day, when he was hunting, Sangkuriang accidentally killed Tumang. His arrow missed the deer he was targeting and hit Tumang instead. He went home and tells her mother about the dog. “What?” Dayang Sumbi was appalled. Driven by sadness and anger, she grabbed a weaving tool and hit Sangkuriang’s head with it. Dayang Sumbi was so sad; she didn’t pay any attention to Sangkuriang and started to cry.<br /><br />Sangkuriang feel sad and also confused. How can his mother love a dog more than him? Sangkuriang then decided to go away from their home and went on a journey. In the morning, Dayang Sumbi finally stopped crying. She started to feel better, so she went to find Sangkuriang. But her son was no where to be found. She looked everywhere but still couldn’t find him. Finally, she went home with nothing. She was exhausted. She fell asleep, and in her dream, she meets her husband. “Dayang Sumbi, don’t be sad. Go look for my body in the woods and get the heart. Soak it with water, and use the water to bathe, and you will look young forever,” said the prince in her dream. After bathing with the water used to soak the dog’s heart, Dayang Sumbi looked more beautiful and even younger.<br /><br />And time passed by. Sangkuriang on his journey stopped at a village and met and fell in love with a beautiful girl.He didn’t realize that the village was his homeland and the beautiful girl was his own mother, Dayang Sumbi. Their love grew naturally and he asked the girl to marry him. One day, Sangkuriang was going on a hunt. He asked Dayang Sumbi to fix the turban on his head. Dayang Sumbi was startled when she saw a scar on his head at the same place where she, years ago, hit Sangkuriang on the head.<br /><br />After the young man left, Dayang Sumbi prayed for guidance. After praying, she became convinced that the young man was indeed her missing son. She realized that she had to do something to prevent Sangkuriang from marrying her. But she did not wish to disappoint him by cancelling the wedding. So, although she agreed to marry Sangkuriang, she would do so only on the condition that he provides her with a lake and built a beautiful boat, all in one night.<br /><br />Sangkuriang accepted this condition without a doubt. He had spent his youth studying magical arts. After the sun went down, Sangkuriang went to the hill. Then he called a group of genie to build a dam around Citarum River. Then, he commands the genies to cut down trees and build a boat. A few moments before dawn, Sangkuriang and his genie servants almost finished the boat.<br /><br />Dayang Sumbi, who had been spying on him, realised that Sangkuriang would fulfill the condition she had set. Dayang Sumbi immediately woke all the women in the village and asked them to wave a long red scarf. All the women in the village were waving red scarf, making it look as if dawn was breaking. Deceived by false dawn, the cock crowed and farmers rose for the new day.<br /><br />Sangkuriang’s genie servants immediately dropped their work and ran for cover from the sun, which they feared. Sangkuriang grew furious. With all his anger, he kicked the unfinished boat. The boat flew and landed on a valley. The boat then became a mountain, called Mount Tangkuban Perahu (Tangkuban means upturned or upside down, and Perahu means boat). With his power, he destroyed the dam. The water drained from the lake becoming a wide plain and nowadays became a city called Bandung (from the word Bendung, which means Dam). <br />
