                        True Friends<br /><br />Once upon a time, there were two close friends who were walking through the forest together. They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.<br /><br />Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not know how to climb up the tree. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.<br /><br />The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place because the bears do not want to touch the dead creatures. After that, the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend that was on the ground, "Friend, what did the bear whisper into your ears?" The other friend replied, "Just now the bear advised me not to believe a false friend."<br />

                        Beauty and the beast<br /><br />
Once
 upon a time as a merchant set off for market, he asked each of his 
three daughters what she would like as a present on his return. The 
first daughter wanted a brocade dress, the second a pearl necklace, but 
the third, whose name was Beauty, the youngest, prettiest and sweetest 
of them all, said to her father:  



 "All I'd like is a rose you've picked specially for me!"   

<br /> When
 the merchant had finished his business, he set off for home. However, a
 sudden storm blew up, and his horse could hardly make headway in the 
howling gale. Cold and weary, the merchant had lost all hope of reaching
 an inn when he suddenly noticed a bright light shining in the middle of
 a wood. As he drew near, he saw that it was a castle, bathed in light.   

"I hope I'll find shelter there for the night," he said to himself. 

<br /> When
 he reached the door, he saw it was open, but though he shouted, nobody 
came to greet him. Plucking up courage, he went inside, still calling 
out to attract attention. On a table in the main hall, a splendid dinner
 lay already served. The merchant lingered, still shouting for the owner
 of the castle. But no one came, and so the starving merchant sat down to a hearty meal.  <br />
Overcome
 by curiosity, he ventured upstairs, where the corridor led into 
magnificent rooms and halls. A fire crackled in the first room and a 
soft bed looked very inviting. It was now late, and the merchant could 
not resist. He lay down on the bed and fell fast asleep. 

<br /> When he woke next morning, an unknown hand had placed a mug of steaming coffee and some fruit by his bedside.  The
 merchant had breakfast and after tidying himself up, went downstairs to
 thank his generous host. But, as on the evening before, there was 
nobody in sight. Shaking his head in wonder at the strangeness of it 
all, he went towards the garden where he had left his horse, tethered to
 a tree.<br />soal:1. who is the antagonist act on the story?2. how can the beast return to a handsome person?<br /><br /><br />

He was almost going to throw it away because he thought that someone was mengerjainya. But once you think about it, he took it home and realized that it was an egg of pure gold!<br />She sells the eggs for money very much. Every morning the goose laying the golden eggs to another, and the farmers became rich by selling eggs.<br />When he became rich, he also grew greedy. "Why do I have to wait to get only one egg a day?" He thought. "I will cut the goose and take all the eggs out of the body at once."<br />When the goose heard the farmer's plan, he immediately flew away to another farm nearby.

He is very thin, so that the line can be seen clearly bones under his thinning hair. With barely enough energy to run, wolves have little hope of finding food. As he lay down under a large tree, a dog was out for a walk to see him. Look how skinny and hungry wolves, the dog felt sorry for him and said, "You are very terrible condition! You looked as if had not eaten for days."<br />"You're right," said the wolf. "I do not eat because you and your friends do a good job of keeping the sheep. Now I'm so weak that I had little hope of finding food. I thought I would die."<br />Then why not join us? asked the dog. "I work out regularly and I eat regularly. You can also do the same. I will set it up. You can help me and other dogs guard the sheep. In that way, we will not have to worry about theft of sheep again and you do not have to worry about going hungry again. It's a good deal for both of us. "<br />The wolf thought about it for a few minutes and then decided that the dog was right. So they went together to the farm house where the dog lived. But, while on the journey, the wolf saw that the hair in a certain part of the dog's neck is very thin. He was curious about it, for dogs that have such a beautiful coat every body. Finally, he asked the dog about it.<br />"Oh, do not worry about it," said the dog. "This is the place where former rope on my neck when I bind my lord at night."<br />"Diikiat!" cried wolf, "you mean that you are chained at night? If I come to stay with you, I will also be chained at night?"<br />That's right, "said the dog." But, you'll get used to it pretty quickly. I do not think about it anymore. "<br />"But, if I was chained, then I will not be able to walk when I want to go for a walk or to run where I want to run," said the wolf. "If I come to stay with you, I will not be free again." Having said that, the wolf turned around and ran.<br />

They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.<br />Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not know how to climb up the tree. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.<br />The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place because the bears do not want to touch the dead creatures. After that, the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend that was on the ground, "Friend, what did the bear whisper into your ears?" The other friend replied, "Just now the bear advised me not to believe a false friend."<br />Moral of the Story- A true friend in need is a friend indeed.<br /><br />Hope it helps:)<br />

                        The Fish and the Salamander At the beginning of time, Fish and Salamander looked very much alike. They were discussing how they planned to evolve. "I wish to grow thinner, with a broad tail," said Fish. "Then, I will swim like lightning and outrace any pond creature. How about you?" Salamander considered, "Well, it would certainly be nice to be the fastest creature in the pond. However, I think will keep my awkward tail, which allows me to swim well enough. What I wish to change instead is to grow modest legs" Fish laughed. "Legs? In a pond? What a waste!" Soon, though, came a drought and the pond began to dry up. Fish was trapped, but Salamander was able to crawl out, to find another pond. "How did you know that legs would come in so handy?" cried Fish to its departing friend. "I didn't," said Salamander, "But I wasn't so naive as to assume that circumstances today would be the same as that of tomorrow." The story tells us that versatility is a lead to Success.<br />

When Aladdin was walking to the entrance, the magician pushed a huge rock over the entrance of the cave and left Aladdin and the lamp behind. Aladdin tried to move the rock all by himself, but it was too big and heavy, “Oh no! I am trapped in the cave!” he cried.<br /><br />Suddenly, he remembered the magic ring. He rubbed it with the palm of his hand. To his surprise, a genie appeared before him and in a powerful voice said, “Master, I am the Genie of the ring. How can I help you?”<br /><br />Aladdin was frightened, but he soon found the courage to ask, “Could you please send me back to my house?” In no time at all Aladdin was back home.<br /><br />Aladdin took out the lamp. He wondered what would happen if he rubbed it. As Aladdin was rubbing it, all of a sudden another enormous genie stood before him. The genie of the lamp said, “Master, your wish is my command.” Aladdin was very excited and wished for an enormous palace and bags full of gold.<br /><br />One day, a beautiful princess was passing by Aladdin’s palace. She stopped to talk to Aladdin and soon they became good friends. Before long, Aladdin and Jasmine fell in love each other. She married Aladdin and lived happily.<br /><br />Questions :<br />1. What is the type of the text?<br />2. What is the text about?<br />3. What is the purpose of the text?<br />4. What kind of generic structure will you find in the text?<br />5. What is the main idea of second paragraph?<br />6. What's in the magic lamp Aladdin asked?<br />7. What is given by the magician to Aladdin?<br />8. "He wondered what would happen if he rubbed it." (8th paragraph). What does the underlined word refer to?<br />9. "The name was Aladdin.

With her magic wand, she gave Cinderella a coach, two horses, and footmen. She also gave Cinderella a lovely dress to wear to the ball and a<br />
pair of glass slippers. She told Cinderella to come home before midnight.<br />

That is how she got her nickname, for everybody called her Cinderella.<br /><br />It was quite true. Cinderella, even dressed in rags with a dusty gray face from the cinders, was a lovely girl. While her stepsisters, no matter how splendid and elegant their clothes, were still clumsy, lumpy, and ugly.<br /><br />One day, a ball was to be held by the royal family of the kingdom to find the prince's spouse. Cinderella's stepsisters ordered beautiful new dress for the ball. Cinderella wanted to go to the ball but her stepmother asked her to stay at home.<br /><br />"You?

In the kitchen, where Cinderella was sitting all by herself, there was a burst of light and a fairy appeared.<br /><br />"Don't be afraid Cinderella, I know what you feel, my dear. Do you want to go to ball?" asked the fairy.<br /><br />"Yes, I do. But look! How can I go to the ball with this dress? Cinderella replied.<br /><br />Then the fairy turned Cinderella's dress became the most beautiful dress and with beautiful slippers, the loveliest ever seen in the realm. The fairy also turned a pumpkin into a parking coach and turned the mice become six white horses.<br /><br />"Now, you can go to the Court and go to the ball. But remember my dear Cinderella, you must leave the ball at midnight and come home. For that is when the spell ends. Your coach will turn back into a pumpkin, the horses will become mice and you will be dressed again in rags with clogs.<br /><br />At the ballroom, Cinderella amazed everybody there include the prince. When the prince set eyes on Cinderella, he was stuck by her beauty. Walking over to her, he bowed deeply and asked her to dance. Cinderella had a wonderful time at the ball. But, all of a sudden, she heard the sound of a clock, the first stroke of midnight.<br /><br />Remembered what the fairy had said, Cinderella ran back to the coach and went home. But he lost one of her slippers in ballroom. The prince who was now madly in love with her, picked up her slipper and would search for the girl whose foot fitted with the slipper.<br /><br />In the next morning, the prince began to search everywhere in the kingdom but no girl whose foot fitted with the slipper. Until he found Cinderella house and asked Cinderella's stepsisters to wear the slipper. But none fitted with the slipper. The prince began hopeless.<br /><br />"Is there any girl else here" Asked the prince.<br /><br />"Yes, there are. But she is very ugly and I think she is not the girl that you are looking for." replied Cinderella's stepmother.<br /><br />"Call her here!" Asked the prince.<br /><br />Then Cinderella's stepmother called Cinderella to come out who was dressed in rags and wore clogs like usual. The prince began to wear the slipper into Cinderella foot, and it was fit.<br /><br />The prince believed that Cinderella was the girl he met in the ball. Then the prince asked Cinderella to marry him. And at the end, Cinderella and the prince lived happily ever after in the kingdom.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />1.
