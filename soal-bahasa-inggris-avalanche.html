                                            tolong urutin dong : 
1. Tsunami is a natural disaster caused by the increasing waves of the sea to land with a high swiftness as the consequence of the quake which is centered under the ocean. The quake can be caused by land erosion, sifted plate, an erupted volcano as well as a meteoroid that falls in the ocean. Tsunami usually happens if the size of the earthquake exceeds until 7 on the Richter scale. This tsunami is quite dangerous, mainly for those who live around the beach. With great force, it will sweep out whatever around it. From all causes of tsunami, earthquake is the major cause.
2. Earthquake causes perpendicular layers motion of earth. As a result, the sea bottom is suddenly up and down, so that the balance of sea water was disturbed on it, similarly with cosmic objects or meteors that fall from above. If the size of a meteor or landslide is quite big, mega tsunami can happen with hundreds of meters high
3.Even though the movement of the ground is horizontal, but the energy of the earthquake is big, and it can cause the collapse of cliffs/hill on the sea automatically in which the movement is perpendicular to the surface of the sea. Although there is no earthquake that hits the land directly which results vertical movement, the condition of a cliff and hill in the sea has been unstable and because of the force of gravity and ocean currents that led to landslides, it causes tsunami.
4.The victim of tsunami is not a little. The casualties are hit by sluggish water flow and material that carried away by the tsunami. Besides the victim, tsunami also has a negative impact on the building, herbs, and pollution to agricultural land, and water.
5.Vertical movement of the earth crust because of a volcanic eruption, an earthquake, the avalanche or a meteor falling to earth can cause the sea floor becomes up or down suddenly therefore it disturbs the balance of water on it. This makes the occurrence of energy flow of sea water on the beach become large waves so that tsunami happens. Billows can spread to all directions. Energy which conceives in the wave of the tsunami is fixed on the function of the altitude. The height of waves in the sea is only about 1 meter. Thus, threat of a wave cannot be felt by a ship that was in the middle of the sea. When it approaches the coast, the speed of the tsunami of decline until about 30 miles per hour, but its height has increased to reach tens of meters. When it reaches the coast, tsunami enters the land until hundreds of meters, even kilometers.
6.An earthquake on the bottom of sea gives rise to an affliction of the sea water that caused by the change of the profile of the ocean floor that generally occurs because of a tectonics earthquake and perpendicular (vertical) ground motion with the surface of the sea water or earth surface. If the movements of the ground are horizontal on the surface of the sea, there will not happen tsunami.</a>

Orientation:
Thousands of years ago in ancient China, there lived a beautiful young woman named Mulan. She lived with her parents and a dog named Little Brother. Mulan's father had once been a great warrior, but his leg had been injured in battle. As an only child, Mulan felt responsible for upholding the family honor. One day, a man arrived with terrible news from the Emperor. The Huns, China's enemy, had invaded. The Emperor had ordered that one man from every family must join the Imperial Army. Mulan's aging father had to fight...again. Mulan knew her father was too old to fight. Late that night, she made a big decision. Mulan knew her father was too old to fight. Late that night, she made a big decision. After saying a prayer to the Ancestors, she used a sword to cut her hair short. Then she put on her father's warrior clothes. As her parents slept, Mulan, now dressed as a young man, jumped onto her father's horse, Khan. Then she raced off to join the Imperial Army in her father's place. Somehow, she would find a way to bring honor to her family. When Mulan arrived at the Imperial Army's training camp, she met Captain Li Shang. "What is your name?" he asked Mulan. "My name? It's, uh...Ping!" Mulan said. To her amazement, Shang and the other soldiers believed she was a man!.
Complication:
Shang worked hard to teach his soldiers strength and discipline. Mulan struggled to keep up. Frustrated, Shang told her to go home. Mulan was not alone on her journey. A dragon named Mushu, sent from the Ancestors to be her guardian, and a cricket named Cri-Kee were always at her side.Working together, they wrote a fake letter ordering Shang and his soldiers to go after the Huns. Now Mulan would get her chance to bring honor to her family. Working together, they wrote a fake letter ordering Shang and his soldiers to go after the Huns. Now Mulan would get her chance to bring honor to her family.Heeding the letter's message, Shang led his soldiers into the mountains. Suddenly, they were surrounded by thousands of Huns. Mulan got an idea. She grabbed the very last cannon and, using Mushu's flame, lit the fuse. The cannon caused a massive avalanche of snow to fall on the Huns. But the danger wasn't over. Snow was now racing toward Mulan and her friends. Mulan's loyal horse, Khan, ran to her side. She jumped onto his back, and just as the snow was about to bury Shang, Mulan pulled him to safety. Mulan's loyal horse, Khan, ran to her side. She jumped onto his back, and just as the snow was about to bury Shang, Mulan pulled him to safety.During the battle, Mulan had been injured. While caring for her wound, a medic realized that "Ping" was a woman. Shang had no choice but to leave Mulan behind. As she sat with Khan, Mushu, and Cri-Kee, Mulan felt she had failed her family and herself. Then she heard the Huns' voices. Mulan raced to the Imperial City to warn Shang. "The Huns are alive!" she told him. "They're in the city." But Shang felt betrayed by Mulan and did not trust her. Mulan tried warning the others, but no one would believe her.
Resolution:
The Hun leader, Shan-Yu, kidnapped the Emperor, but Mulan and Shang rescued him. Furious, Shan-Yu chased Mulan onto the palace roof - exactly as she planned. Mulan grabbed Shan-Yu's sword and pinned his coat to the roof. He couldn't move when Mushu and Cri-Kee shot a rocket his way. The force of the explosion sent Mushu and Cri-Kee flying through the air. Mulan and Shang fell together to the ground as fireworks began to fill the sky. The people were celebrating. The Huns had been banished, and the Imperial City was safe! The Emperor was very grateful to Mulan. "You have saved us all," he said, and then he did something extraordinary: The Emperor bowed to Mulan. Everyone in the plaza bowed to Mulan, too. The Emperor asked her to stay on as his adviser, but Mulan knew it was time to return to her family.
Re-Orientation:
At home, Mulan presented her father with a sword given to her by the Emperor. "The greatest gift and honor is having you for a daughter," her father said. "I've missed you so." "Excuse me," said a voice behind them. "Does Mulan live here?" Shang had brought Mulan her helmet...and she invited him to stay for dinner.</a>

                                            mohon di arti kan?The climbing season on Mount Everest was temporarily halted after a 7.8-magnitude earthquake on April 25 caused avalanches in Nepal and killed at least 5,000 people.On Mount Everest, 18 people died in a quake-related avalanche. Climbing reportedly will resume next week.Mike Hamill, an American climber who leads excursions through International Mountain Guides, was on the mountain at the time and recounted his story to National Geographic.“We were enveloped by a black cloud; a roiling mass of snow, air, and rock that shook our tents and blanketed our camp with an inch of white,” he wrote in a blog post using his smartphone. “I clambered inside a storage tent with Phu Nuru and pressed against the strong metal poles to keep it erect. It was terrifying. Like a hurricane. There was no escaping, and we didn’t know if we would come out the other side.”After the avalanche passed, Hamill wrote, the traditional landmarks like flags and paths used to find the way were gone. Hamill and others who were not injured worked to help injured climbers and Sherpas and transport wounded into helicopters.Photographer Roberto Schmidt was on assignment on Everest for France’s Agence France-Presse when the earthquake hit.“You have this wind and then it’s like a wave crashing, we were swept up, you don’t know if whether you are upside down or what. You are just tumbling,” he said to The Guardian. “Finally I came to, resting on my back and then I felt this ‘tack, tack’ sound of falling rocks and you know I just felt ‘This is it. I’m going to be buried alive.’”Another survivor, Australian climber Ronald Nissen, was at the base camp when the avalanche hit.“Those couple of minutes were without doubt the scariest of my life as I lay there with my hands over my head,” Nissen told NBC News. “Everything was ripped away from us. The avalanche came through the base and it wiped the camp off the face of the earth. Dining, cooking, sleeping tents, everything vanished.”Thomas Martienssen of the BBC also witnessed the avalanche that killed 18.“On all three sides, it sounded like, when you’re in the pub, and someone presses the button on a pool table to release the balls, and the balls fall together and hit the bottom — it was like that, but a million times louder,” he told the BBC. “And then you get this rumble, this deep rumble coming towards you.”</a>

The most common consequences of this are population movements as large numbers of people are often forced to flee the moving lava flow. Volcanic eruptions often cause temporary food shortages and volcanic ash landslides called Lahar. The most dangerous type of volcanic eruption is referred to as a 'glowing avalanche'. This is when freshly erupted magma forms hot pyroclastic flow which have temperatures of up to 1,200 degrees. The pyroclastic flow is formed from rock fragments following a volcanic explosion , the flow surges down the flanks of the volcano at speeds of up to several hundred kilometres per hour, to distances often up to 10km and occasionally as far as 40 km from the original disaster site. The International Federation response adjusts to meet the needs of each specific circumstance. As population movement is often a consequence, the provision of safe areas, shelter, water, food and health supplies are primordial. In general response prioritizes temporary shelter materials; safe water and basic sanitation; food supplies; and the short term provision of basic health services and supplies. ​</a>

                                            TsunamiTsunami is a natural disaster caused by the increasing waves of the sea to land with a high swiftness as the consequence of the quake which is centred under the ocean. The quake can be caused by land erosion, sifted plate, an erupted volcano as well as a meteoroid that falls in the ocean. Tsunami usually happens if the size of the earthquake exceed until 7 on the Richter scale. This tsunami is quite dangerous, mainly for those who live around the beach. With great force, it will sweep out whatever around it. From all causes of tsunami, earthquake is the major cause.An earthquake on the bottom of sea gives rise to an affliction of the sea water that caused by the change of the profile of the ocean floor that generally occurs because of a tectonics earthquake and perpendicular (vertical) ground motion with the surface of the sea water or earth surface. If the movements of the ground are horizontal on the surface of the sea, there will not happen tsunami.Even though the movement of the ground is horizontal, but the energy of the earthquake is big, and it can cause the collapse of cliffs/hill on the sea automatically in which the movement is perpendicular to the surface of the sea. Although there is no earthquake that hits the land directly which results vertical movement, the condition of a cliff and hill in the sea has been unstable and because of the force of gravity and ocean currents that led to landslides, it causes tsunami.Earthquake causes perpendicular layers motion of earth. As a result, the sea bottom is suddenly up and down, so that the balance of sea water was disturbed on it, similarly with cosmic objects or meteors that fall from above. If the size of a meteor or landslide is quite big, megatsunami can happen with hundreds of meters high.Vertical movement of the earth crust because of a volcanic eruption, an earthquake, the avalanche or a meteor falling to earth can cause the sea floor becomes up or down suddenly therefore it disturbs the balance of water on it. This makes the occurrence of energy flow of sea water on the beach become large waves so that tsunami happens. Billows can spread to all directions. Energy which conceives in the wave of the tsunami is fixed on the function of the altitude. The height of waves in the sea is only about 1 meter. Thus, the rate of a wave cannot be felt by a ship that was in the middle of the sea. When it approaches the coast, the speed of the tsunami of decline until about 30 miles per hour, but its height has increased to reach tens of meters. When it reaches the coast, tsunami enters the land until hundreds of meters, even kilometres.The victim of tsunami is not a little. The casualties are hit by sluggish water flow and material that carried away by the tsunami. Besides the victim, tsunami also has a negative impact on the building, herbs, and pollution to agricultural land, and water.tolong dibantu kak, pertanyaan nya di gambar, terimakasih​</a>

                                            "Volcanic eruptions happen when lava and gas are discharged from a volcanic vent." What is the word "eruption" closing meaning to?Volcanic eruptions happen when lava and gas are discharged from a volcanic vent. The most common consequences of this are population movements as large numbers of people are often forced to flee the moving lava flow. Volcanic eruptions often cause temporary food shortages and volcanic ash landslides called Lahar. The most dangerous type of volcanic eruption is referred to as a 'glowing avalanche'. This is when freshly erupted magma forms hot pyroclastic flow which have temperatures of up to 1,200 degrees. The pyroclastic flow is formed from rock fragments following a volcanic explosion, the flow surges down the flanks of the volcano at speeds of up to several hundred kilometres per hour, to distances often up to 10 km and occasionally as far as 40 km from the original disaster site. The International Federation response adjusts to meet the needs of each specific circumstance. As population movement is often a consequence, the provision of safe areas, shelter, water, food and health supplies are primordial. In general response prioritizes temporary shelter materials, safe water and basic sanitation; food supplies; and the short term provision of basic health services and supplies. A. Landslide B.

A strong earthquake aftershock struck India and Nepal on Sunday, shaking buildings in New Delhi and triggering an avalanche in the Himalayas.
The United States Geological Survey said the tremor was 6.7 magnitude, less than the 7.9 quake that struck the region on Saturday killing at least 1,900 people.
"Another one, we have an aftershock right now," Indian mountaineer Arjun Vajpai told Reuters by telephone from base camp on Mount Makalu, 20 km (12 miles) from Everest.
Screams and the sound of an avalanche could be heard over the phone line Vajpai was speaking on. At Everest base camp, Romanian climber Alex Gavan tweeted that the aftershock had set off three avalanches.

                            5. tolong urutin dong : 
1. Tsunami is a natural disaster caused by the increasing waves of the sea to land with a high swiftness as the consequence of the quake which is centered under the ocean. The quake can be caused by land erosion, sifted plate, an erupted volcano as well as a meteoroid that falls in the ocean. Tsunami usually happens if the size of the earthquake exceeds until 7 on the Richter scale. This tsunami is quite dangerous, mainly for those who live around the beach. With great force, it will sweep out whatever around it. From all causes of tsunami, earthquake is the major cause.
2. Earthquake causes perpendicular layers motion of earth. As a result, the sea bottom is suddenly up and down, so that the balance of sea water was disturbed on it, similarly with cosmic objects or meteors that fall from above. If the size of a meteor or landslide is quite big, mega tsunami can happen with hundreds of meters high
3.Even though the movement of the ground is horizontal, but the energy of the earthquake is big, and it can cause the collapse of cliffs/hill on the sea automatically in which the movement is perpendicular to the surface of the sea. Although there is no earthquake that hits the land directly which results vertical movement, the condition of a cliff and hill in the sea has been unstable and because of the force of gravity and ocean currents that led to landslides, it causes tsunami.
4.The victim of tsunami is not a little. The casualties are hit by sluggish water flow and material that carried away by the tsunami. Besides the victim, tsunami also has a negative impact on the building, herbs, and pollution to agricultural land, and water.
5.Vertical movement of the earth crust because of a volcanic eruption, an earthquake, the avalanche or a meteor falling to earth can cause the sea floor becomes up or down suddenly therefore it disturbs the balance of water on it. This makes the occurrence of energy flow of sea water on the beach become large waves so that tsunami happens. Billows can spread to all directions. Energy which conceives in the wave of the tsunami is fixed on the function of the altitude. The height of waves in the sea is only about 1 meter. Thus, threat of a wave cannot be felt by a ship that was in the middle of the sea. When it approaches the coast, the speed of the tsunami of decline until about 30 miles per hour, but its height has increased to reach tens of meters. When it reaches the coast, tsunami enters the land until hundreds of meters, even kilometers.
6.An earthquake on the bottom of sea gives rise to an affliction of the sea water that caused by the change of the profile of the ocean floor that generally occurs because of a tectonics earthquake and perpendicular (vertical) ground motion with the surface of the sea water or earth surface. If the movements of the ground are horizontal on the surface of the sea, there will not happen tsunami.</h2><br />

Orientation:
Thousands of years ago in ancient China, there lived a beautiful young woman named Mulan. She lived with her parents and a dog named Little Brother. Mulan's father had once been a great warrior, but his leg had been injured in battle. As an only child, Mulan felt responsible for upholding the family honor. One day, a man arrived with terrible news from the Emperor. The Huns, China's enemy, had invaded. The Emperor had ordered that one man from every family must join the Imperial Army. Mulan's aging father had to fight...again. Mulan knew her father was too old to fight. Late that night, she made a big decision. Mulan knew her father was too old to fight. Late that night, she made a big decision. After saying a prayer to the Ancestors, she used a sword to cut her hair short. Then she put on her father's warrior clothes. As her parents slept, Mulan, now dressed as a young man, jumped onto her father's horse, Khan. Then she raced off to join the Imperial Army in her father's place. Somehow, she would find a way to bring honor to her family. When Mulan arrived at the Imperial Army's training camp, she met Captain Li Shang. "What is your name?" he asked Mulan. "My name? It's, uh...Ping!" Mulan said. To her amazement, Shang and the other soldiers believed she was a man!.
Complication:
Shang worked hard to teach his soldiers strength and discipline. Mulan struggled to keep up. Frustrated, Shang told her to go home. Mulan was not alone on her journey. A dragon named Mushu, sent from the Ancestors to be her guardian, and a cricket named Cri-Kee were always at her side.Working together, they wrote a fake letter ordering Shang and his soldiers to go after the Huns. Now Mulan would get her chance to bring honor to her family. Working together, they wrote a fake letter ordering Shang and his soldiers to go after the Huns. Now Mulan would get her chance to bring honor to her family.Heeding the letter's message, Shang led his soldiers into the mountains. Suddenly, they were surrounded by thousands of Huns. Mulan got an idea. She grabbed the very last cannon and, using Mushu's flame, lit the fuse. The cannon caused a massive avalanche of snow to fall on the Huns. But the danger wasn't over. Snow was now racing toward Mulan and her friends. Mulan's loyal horse, Khan, ran to her side. She jumped onto his back, and just as the snow was about to bury Shang, Mulan pulled him to safety. Mulan's loyal horse, Khan, ran to her side. She jumped onto his back, and just as the snow was about to bury Shang, Mulan pulled him to safety.During the battle, Mulan had been injured. While caring for her wound, a medic realized that "Ping" was a woman. Shang had no choice but to leave Mulan behind. As she sat with Khan, Mushu, and Cri-Kee, Mulan felt she had failed her family and herself. Then she heard the Huns' voices. Mulan raced to the Imperial City to warn Shang. "The Huns are alive!" she told him. "They're in the city." But Shang felt betrayed by Mulan and did not trust her. Mulan tried warning the others, but no one would believe her.
Resolution:
The Hun leader, Shan-Yu, kidnapped the Emperor, but Mulan and Shang rescued him. Furious, Shan-Yu chased Mulan onto the palace roof - exactly as she planned. Mulan grabbed Shan-Yu's sword and pinned his coat to the roof. He couldn't move when Mushu and Cri-Kee shot a rocket his way. The force of the explosion sent Mushu and Cri-Kee flying through the air. Mulan and Shang fell together to the ground as fireworks began to fill the sky. The people were celebrating. The Huns had been banished, and the Imperial City was safe! The Emperor was very grateful to Mulan. "You have saved us all," he said, and then he did something extraordinary: The Emperor bowed to Mulan. Everyone in the plaza bowed to Mulan, too. The Emperor asked her to stay on as his adviser, but Mulan knew it was time to return to her family.
Re-Orientation:
At home, Mulan presented her father with a sword given to her by the Emperor. "The greatest gift and honor is having you for a daughter," her father said. "I've missed you so." "Excuse me," said a voice behind them. "Does Mulan live here?" Shang had brought Mulan her helmet...and she invited him to stay for dinner.</h2><br />

                            11. mohon di arti kan?The climbing season on Mount Everest was temporarily halted after a 7.8-magnitude earthquake on April 25 caused avalanches in Nepal and killed at least 5,000 people.On Mount Everest, 18 people died in a quake-related avalanche. Climbing reportedly will resume next week.Mike Hamill, an American climber who leads excursions through International Mountain Guides, was on the mountain at the time and recounted his story to National Geographic.“We were enveloped by a black cloud; a roiling mass of snow, air, and rock that shook our tents and blanketed our camp with an inch of white,” he wrote in a blog post using his smartphone. “I clambered inside a storage tent with Phu Nuru and pressed against the strong metal poles to keep it erect. It was terrifying. Like a hurricane. There was no escaping, and we didn’t know if we would come out the other side.”After the avalanche passed, Hamill wrote, the traditional landmarks like flags and paths used to find the way were gone. Hamill and others who were not injured worked to help injured climbers and Sherpas and transport wounded into helicopters.Photographer Roberto Schmidt was on assignment on Everest for France’s Agence France-Presse when the earthquake hit.“You have this wind and then it’s like a wave crashing, we were swept up, you don’t know if whether you are upside down or what. You are just tumbling,” he said to The Guardian. “Finally I came to, resting on my back and then I felt this ‘tack, tack’ sound of falling rocks and you know I just felt ‘This is it. I’m going to be buried alive.’”Another survivor, Australian climber Ronald Nissen, was at the base camp when the avalanche hit.“Those couple of minutes were without doubt the scariest of my life as I lay there with my hands over my head,” Nissen told NBC News. “Everything was ripped away from us. The avalanche came through the base and it wiped the camp off the face of the earth. Dining, cooking, sleeping tents, everything vanished.”Thomas Martienssen of the BBC also witnessed the avalanche that killed 18.“On all three sides, it sounded like, when you’re in the pub, and someone presses the button on a pool table to release the balls, and the balls fall together and hit the bottom — it was like that, but a million times louder,” he told the BBC. “And then you get this rumble, this deep rumble coming towards you.”</h2><br />

                            19. KA tolong bantu Carikan Kat yang sulit menurut Kaka yang di artikan???Volcanic eruptions happen when lava and gas are discharged from a volcanic vent. The most common consequences of this are population movements as large numbers of people are often forced to flee the moving lava flow. Volcanic eruptions often cause temporary food shortages and volcanic ash landslides called Lahar. The most dangerous type of volcanic eruption is referred to as a 'glowing avalanche'. This is when freshly erupted magma forms hot pyroclastic flow which have temperatures of up to 1,200 degrees. The pyroclastic flow is formed from rock fragments following a volcanic explosion , the flow surges down the flanks of the volcano at speeds of up to several hundred kilometres per hour, to distances often up to 10km and occasionally as far as 40 km from the original disaster site. The International Federation response adjusts to meet the needs of each specific circumstance. As population movement is often a consequence, the provision of safe areas, shelter, water, food and health supplies are primordial. In general response prioritizes temporary shelter materials; safe water and basic sanitation; food supplies; and the short term provision of basic health services and supplies. ​</h2><br />

                            27. TsunamiTsunami is a natural disaster caused by the increasing waves of the sea to land with a high swiftness as the consequence of the quake which is centred under the ocean. The quake can be caused by land erosion, sifted plate, an erupted volcano as well as a meteoroid that falls in the ocean. Tsunami usually happens if the size of the earthquake exceed until 7 on the Richter scale. This tsunami is quite dangerous, mainly for those who live around the beach. With great force, it will sweep out whatever around it. From all causes of tsunami, earthquake is the major cause.An earthquake on the bottom of sea gives rise to an affliction of the sea water that caused by the change of the profile of the ocean floor that generally occurs because of a tectonics earthquake and perpendicular (vertical) ground motion with the surface of the sea water or earth surface. If the movements of the ground are horizontal on the surface of the sea, there will not happen tsunami.Even though the movement of the ground is horizontal, but the energy of the earthquake is big, and it can cause the collapse of cliffs/hill on the sea automatically in which the movement is perpendicular to the surface of the sea. Although there is no earthquake that hits the land directly which results vertical movement, the condition of a cliff and hill in the sea has been unstable and because of the force of gravity and ocean currents that led to landslides, it causes tsunami.Earthquake causes perpendicular layers motion of earth. As a result, the sea bottom is suddenly up and down, so that the balance of sea water was disturbed on it, similarly with cosmic objects or meteors that fall from above. If the size of a meteor or landslide is quite big, megatsunami can happen with hundreds of meters high.Vertical movement of the earth crust because of a volcanic eruption, an earthquake, the avalanche or a meteor falling to earth can cause the sea floor becomes up or down suddenly therefore it disturbs the balance of water on it. This makes the occurrence of energy flow of sea water on the beach become large waves so that tsunami happens. Billows can spread to all directions. Energy which conceives in the wave of the tsunami is fixed on the function of the altitude. The height of waves in the sea is only about 1 meter. Thus, the rate of a wave cannot be felt by a ship that was in the middle of the sea. When it approaches the coast, the speed of the tsunami of decline until about 30 miles per hour, but its height has increased to reach tens of meters. When it reaches the coast, tsunami enters the land until hundreds of meters, even kilometres.The victim of tsunami is not a little. The casualties are hit by sluggish water flow and material that carried away by the tsunami. Besides the victim, tsunami also has a negative impact on the building, herbs, and pollution to agricultural land, and water.tolong dibantu kak, pertanyaan nya di gambar, terimakasih​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Tsunami</p><p> Tsunami adalah bencana alam yang disebabkan oleh meningkatnya gelombang laut untuk mendarat dengan kecepatan tinggi sebagai akibat dari gempa yang berpusat di bawah laut. Gempa dapat disebabkan oleh erosi tanah, plat yang diayak, sebuah gunung berapi yang telah meletus dan juga meteoroid yang jatuh di lautan. Tsunami biasanya terjadi jika ukuran gempa melebihi hingga 7 skala Richter. Tsunami ini cukup berbahaya, terutama bagi mereka yang tinggal di sekitar pantai. Dengan kekuatan besar, itu akan menyapu apa pun di sekitarnya. Dari semua penyebab tsunami, gempa bumi adalah penyebab utama. Gempa bumi di dasar laut menimbulkan penderitaan air laut yang disebabkan oleh perubahan profil dasar samudra yang umumnya terjadi karena gempa tektonik dan gerakan tanah tegak lurus dengan permukaan air laut atau permukaan bumi. Jika pergerakan tanah horizontal pada permukaan laut, tidak akan terjadi tsunami. Meskipun gerakan tanah itu horizontal, tetapi energi gempa bumi besar, dan dapat menyebabkan runtuhnya tebing/bukit di laut secara otomatis di mana gerakan itu tegak lurus ke permukaan laut. Meskipun tidak ada gempa bumi yang hits tanah langsung yang menghasilkan gerakan vertikal, kondisi tebing dan bukit di laut telah stabil dan karena gaya gravitasi dan arus laut yang menyebabkan tanah longsor, itu menyebabkan tsunami. Gempa bumi menyebabkan lapisan perpendicular</p><p></p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p>AKU ARTIIN AJA YAAA</p><br />

                            29. "Volcanic eruptions happen when lava and gas are discharged from a volcanic vent." What is the word "eruption" closing meaning to?Volcanic eruptions happen when lava and gas are discharged from a volcanic vent. The most common consequences of this are population movements as large numbers of people are often forced to flee the moving lava flow. Volcanic eruptions often cause temporary food shortages and volcanic ash landslides called Lahar. The most dangerous type of volcanic eruption is referred to as a 'glowing avalanche'. This is when freshly erupted magma forms hot pyroclastic flow which have temperatures of up to 1,200 degrees. The pyroclastic flow is formed from rock fragments following a volcanic explosion, the flow surges down the flanks of the volcano at speeds of up to several hundred kilometres per hour, to distances often up to 10 km and occasionally as far as 40 km from the original disaster site. The International Federation response adjusts to meet the needs of each specific circumstance. As population movement is often a consequence, the provision of safe areas, shelter, water, food and health supplies are primordial. In general response prioritizes temporary shelter materials, safe water and basic sanitation; food supplies; and the short term provision of basic health services and supplies. A. Landslide B.

                        <p>I would like to pick Tsunami.</p><p>A tsunami is a natural disaster which is a series of fast-moving waves in the ocean caused by powerful earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, or simply an asteroid or a meteor crash inside the ocean. A tsunami has a very long wavelength. It can be hundreds of kilometers long. Usually, a tsunami starts suddenly. The waves travel at a great speed across an ocean with little energy loss. They can remove sand from beaches, destroy trees, toss and drag vehicles, houses and even destroy whole towns. Tsunamis can even be caused when a meteorite strikes the earth's surface, though it is very rare. A tsunami normally occurs in the Pacific Ocean, especially in what is called the ring of fire, but can occur in any large body of water.
</p><p>
</p><p>The water often draws back from the seacoast half of the wave period prior to the wave getting to the coast. If the slope of the coast is not steep, the water may pull back for hundreds of meters. People who do not know of the danger often remain at the shore.
</p><p>
</p><p>Tsunamis cannot be prevented. However, there are ways to help stop people dying from a tsunami. International and regional warning systems, especially for the Pacific Ocean, issue alerts before the big waves reach the shore. Because the earthquake that caused the tsunami can be felt before the wave gets to the shore, people can be warned to go somewhere safe.
</p><p>
</p><p>Tsunamis are often called tidal waves because they usually rise and fall more slowly than ordinary ocean surface waves. This name is misleading, because tsunamis are not related to tides; they merely rise slowly as a series of fast-moving waves in the ocean caused by powerful earthquakes or volcanic eruptions.
</p><p>
</p><p>The deadliest tsunami recorded in documented history was on 26 December 2004, and is known as the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. It was caused by an earthquake. The earthquake was said to have a magnitude of 9.3 on the Moment magnitude scale. It was centered in the ocean near the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. Over 215,000 people, mainly on the shores of the Indian Ocean, died from this disaster. The giant wave moved very quickly. Thousands of people in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, India, Somalia, and other nations, were killed or injured by it.
</p><p>
</p><p>Yet, the most expensive tsunami ever was the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. It is said to have cost the Japanese government around $150 billion, which is equivalent to about 12 trillion yen. It went a huge distance in inland, and is also the 4th largest tsunami in history.
</p><p>
</p><p>There is another type of tsunami known as a megatsunami, which is mainly due to external impact on the ocean, like an asteroid or meteor crash, a landslide, a rockslide etc.</p><br />

A strong earthquake aftershock struck India and Nepal on Sunday, shaking buildings in New Delhi and triggering an avalanche in the Himalayas.
The United States Geological Survey said the tremor was 6.7 magnitude, less than the 7.9 quake that struck the region on Saturday killing at least 1,900 people.
"Another one, we have an aftershock right now," Indian mountaineer Arjun Vajpai told Reuters by telephone from base camp on Mount Makalu, 20 km (12 miles) from Everest.
Screams and the sound of an avalanche could be heard over the phone line Vajpai was speaking on. At Everest base camp, Romanian climber Alex Gavan tweeted that the aftershock had set off three avalanches.
